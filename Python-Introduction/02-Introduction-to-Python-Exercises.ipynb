        "## How to cook the perfect egg\n",
        "As an egg cooks, the proteins first denature and then coagulate. When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63°C, while in the yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70°C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63°C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70°C. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach 70°C. The following formula expresses the time $t$ it takes (in seconds) for the center of the yolk to reach the temperature $T_y$ (in Celsius degrees):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$t = \\frac{M^{2/3}c\\rho^{1/3}}{K\\pi^2(4\\pi/3)^{2/3}}\\ln\\left[0.76\\frac{T_o - T_w}{T_y - T_w}\\right]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, $M, \\rho, c$ and $K$ are properties of the egg: $M$ is the mass, $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $K$ is thermal conductivity. Relevant values are $M$ = 47 g for a small egg and $M$ = 67 g for a large egg, $\\rho$ = 1.038 g cm$^{-3}$, $c$ = 3.7 J g$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, and $K$ = 5.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ W cm$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, $T_w$ is the temperature (in C degrees) of the boiling water, and $T_o$ is the original temperature (in C degrees) of the egg before being put in the water.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement the formula in a program, set $T_w$ = 100°C and $T_y$ = 70°C, and compute $t$ for a small and large egg taken from the fridge ($T_o$ = 4°C) and from room temperature ($T_o$ = 20°C)."
